# Module 3 - Lesson 1 - Python Dictionaries
Author: Elizabeth Yates

In this repository, I'm completing the following assignment: 

1. Real-World Python Dictionary Applications
Objective: The aim of this assignment is to reinforce your understanding and application of Python dictionaries, nested collections, and dictionary methods.

Task 1: Restaurant Menu Update (restaurant_menu_update.py)
You are given an initial structure of a restaurant menu stored in a nested dictionary. Your task is to update this menu based on given instructions

Problem Statement: Given the initial menu:

restaurant_menu = {
    "Starters": {"Soup": 5.99, "Bruschetta": 6.50},
    "Main Course": {"Steak": 15.99, "Salmon": 13.99},
    "Desserts": {"Cake": 4.99, "Ice Cream": 3.99}
}

Instructions:
- Add a new category called "Beverages" with at least two items.
- Update the price of "Steak" to 17.99.
- Remove "Bruschetta" from "Starters". 

2. Python Programming Challenges for Customer Service Data Handling

Task 1: Customer Service Ticket Tracker (customer_service_ticket_tracker.py)
Demonstrate your ability to use nested collections and loops by creating a system to track customer service tickets.

Problem Statement:

Develop a program that:
- Tracks customer service tickets, each with a unique ID, customer name, issue description, and status (open/closed).

Implement functions to:
- Open a new service ticket.
- Update the status of an existing ticket.
- Display all tickets or filter by status.

Initialize with some sample tickets and include functionality for additional ticket entry.

Example ticket structure:

service_tickets = {
    "Ticket001": {"Customer": "Alice", "Issue": "Login problem", "Status": "open"},
    "Ticket002": {"Customer": "Bob", "Issue": "Payment issue", "Status": "closed"}
}
